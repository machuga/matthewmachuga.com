- title: Tests Should Tell a Story
  event: Laracon US
  location: Louisville, KY
  type: talk
  description: |
               Through an analogy of storytelling, this talk aims to help you
               be the hero of your testing story by giving new context and
               perspective to the way a test suite should read to both your
               colleagues and your future self. We'll demonstrate how proper
               naming and assertions can lead to simpler, faster debugging.
               We'll also see how an end-to-end test has a far more compelling
               story when you focus on describing the feature and business
               goals over describing a specific UI workflow in painful detail.
  topics:
    - Testing
    - BDD
    - Proper Naming

               Object Oriented Design can add a lot to a project with just a little effort.
               With a bit of OOD code flows more naturally, can be refactored easier and tests become simpler to write.
               We will discuss these ideas as well as compare and contrast various design techniques.
  topics:
    - Laravel
    - Object-Oriented Design
    - Testing
    - Responsibility
    - PHP History
    - Polymorphism
    - Duck Typing
    - Type Hinting
