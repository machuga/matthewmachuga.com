  I'm an Engineering Leader from Erie, PA. I specialize in growing teams and organizations
  to develop, maintain, and scale web applications of various sizes and complexity.

  Prior to moving into leadership, I built and maintained several high-traffic
  and high-throughput applications in NodeJS, Ruby, and PHP with fantastic
  engineering teams ranging from 16 to 200+ engineers.

  I like to speak at conferences, work on open source, and write about
  technical and engineering leadership topics. Sometimes I turn them
  into bigger projects. If any of that sounds interesting, please sign
